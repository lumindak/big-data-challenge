# big-data-challenge
Part 1:
I have used two big Data Sets from Amazon customer review data sets. The data sets are 
1. amazon_reviews_us_Toys_v1_00.tsv
2. amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv

The data sets were saved in the AWS cloud environment. ETL part was done in Google, Colab. The data was saved in Amazon RDS. PostgreSQL was used to create the schemas.

Part 2:
The second data set was analyzed using PySpark. The following results were obtained. Also a Machine learning model was created to predict the user rating using the revirews

no. of reviews : 960680
mean value of  rating (out of 5) :4.14
Standard deviation : 1.29
minimum : 1
maximum: 5


Used: PySpark, Colab, ETL, Cloud Services (AWS), PostgreSQL
